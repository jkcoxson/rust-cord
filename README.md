A Discord bot API library for the Rust programming language
Based on discord.js

# This is still in basic development. So far you can only log in. All code is subject to change.

- [x] Log in to the Discord gateway
- [x] Send and maintain heartbeat packets automatically
- [ ] Make a real intent system (currently just chooses highest intent)
- [ ] Parse opcode 0 packets
- [ ] Reconnect on zombified threads
- [ ] Custom callback system (in progress)
- [ ] Define all types based on Discord.js
- [ ] Handle all opcodes
- [ ] Handle rate limits using a queue system
- [ ] Cache things like members

## No warranty, don't be stupid, if you're about to break something just don't.
